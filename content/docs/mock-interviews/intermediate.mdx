# Intermediate Level

This section covers advanced DevOps concepts and questions commonly asked in interviews for experienced professionals.

<Steps>
<Step>
**Explain the difference between Docker and Kubernetes.**  

| **Feature**    | **Docker**                     | **Kubernetes** |
|--------------|--------------------------------|--------------|
| Purpose     | Containerization tool | Orchestration of containers |
| Deployment | Single-node containers | Multi-node cluster management |
| Scaling    | Manual scaling | Auto-scaling |
</Step>

<Step>
**What is Blue-Green Deployment?**  

A strategy where two environments (Blue & Green) exist:  

- **Blue** ‚Äì Active  
- **Green** ‚Äì Staging (new version)  
Switching traffic to Green reduces downtime.
</Step>

<Step>
**How does Terraform differ from Ansible?**  

- **Terraform**: Declarative, cloud provisioning  
- **Ansible**: Configuration management, procedural  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is Canary Deployment?**  

A small subset of users receives the new update before a full rollout.
</Step>

<Step>
**What are Helm charts in Kubernetes?**  

Helm automates Kubernetes app deployment using **predefined templates**.
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a rolling update in Kubernetes?**  

A **rolling update** gradually replaces old pods with new ones without downtime.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you handle secrets securely in a DevOps pipeline?**  

1. **HashiCorp Vault**  
2. **AWS Secrets Manager**  
3. **Kubernetes Secrets**  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is an immutable infrastructure?**  

Infrastructure where components are **never modified** after deployment, reducing configuration drift.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are the different types of Kubernetes services?**  

1. **ClusterIP** ‚Äì Internal communication  
2. **NodePort** ‚Äì Exposes a service on a port  
3. **LoadBalancer** ‚Äì External traffic balancing  
</Step>

<Step>
**How does Prometheus monitor Kubernetes clusters?**  

- Uses **exporters** to collect metrics  
- **Stores time-series data**  
- **Alerts on anomalies** via Alertmanager  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the difference between monolithic and microservices architectures?**  

| **Aspect**   | **Monolithic** | **Microservices** |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| Scalability | Harder       | Easier |
| Deployment  | Single unit  | Independent services |
| Maintenance | Complex     | Easier |
</Step>

<Step>
**How does Ansible differ from Chef and Puppet?**  

- **Ansible** ‚Äì Agentless, YAML-based, simple  
- **Chef/Puppet** ‚Äì Require agents, more complex  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you ensure high availability in a cloud environment?**  

1. **Multi-AZ Deployments**  
2. **Load Balancing**  
3. **Auto Scaling**  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you handle stateful applications in Kubernetes?**  

Using **StatefulSets**, **Persistent Volumes**, and **Storage Classes**.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a sidecar container pattern in Kubernetes?**  

A sidecar runs alongside the main app container to handle **logging, monitoring, or proxying**.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you implement security in a CI/CD pipeline?**  

1. **Static Code Analysis (SAST)**  
2. **Container Scanning**  
3. **Dependency Scanning**  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the concept of "Shift Left" in DevOps security?**  

"Shift Left" integrates security **earlier in the development cycle**, reducing vulnerabilities.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a Kubernetes DaemonSet?**  

A **DaemonSet** ensures that a pod runs on every node.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the difference between proactive and reactive monitoring?**  

- **Proactive** ‚Äì Prevents issues (threshold-based alerts)  
- **Reactive** ‚Äì Responds to issues (post-failure logs)  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the role of service mesh in Kubernetes?**  

A **service mesh** (e.g., Istio) manages service-to-service communication, security, and monitoring.
</Step>
</Steps>
