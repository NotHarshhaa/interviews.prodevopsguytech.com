# Beginner Level

This section covers fundamental DevOps concepts and questions commonly asked in entry-level interviews.

<Steps>
<Step>
**What is DevOps, and why is it important?**  

DevOps is a **set of practices** that combines **software development (Dev)** and **IT operations (Ops)** to shorten the **software development lifecycle (SDLC)** while ensuring **high quality and reliability**.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How does DevOps differ from traditional IT operations?**  

| **Aspect**       | **Traditional IT Operations** | **DevOps** |
|-----------------|------------------------------|------------|
| Development & Operations | Separate teams | Integrated teams |
| Deployment Frequency | Weeks/Months | Daily/Weekly |
| Automation | Limited | Extensive (CI/CD, IaC) |
| Collaboration | Siloed | Cross-functional |
| Feedback Loop | Slow | Fast (Continuous Monitoring) |
</Step>

<Step>
**What are the key principles of DevOps?**  

1. **Collaboration** ‚Äì Breaking silos between Dev & Ops  
2. **Automation** ‚Äì CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code (IaC)  
3. **Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**  
4. **Monitoring & Logging** ‚Äì Observability, real-time feedback  
5. **Security (DevSecOps)** ‚Äì Security integrated into SDLC  
</Step>

<Step>
**Explain the DevOps lifecycle.**  

1. **Plan** ‚Äì Jira, Trello  
2. **Develop** ‚Äì Git, GitHub  
3. **Build** ‚Äì Maven, Gradle  
4. **Test** ‚Äì Selenium, JUnit  
5. **Release** ‚Äì GitHub Actions, Jenkins  
6. **Deploy** ‚Äì Kubernetes, Docker  
7. **Monitor** ‚Äì Prometheus, Grafana  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are some common DevOps tools?**  

- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI  
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible, Puppet  
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes  
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is CI/CD, and how does it work?**  

CI/CD is a DevOps practice that automates code integration, testing, and deployment.  

- **Continuous Integration (CI)** ‚Äì Automates code merging & testing.  
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)** ‚Äì Automates production releases.  
</Step>

<Step>
**Explain the difference between Continuous Deployment and Continuous Delivery.**  

| **Aspect**      | **Continuous Delivery** | **Continuous Deployment** |
|---------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Automation   | Deployments require manual approval | Fully automated deployments |
| Risk        | Lower risk, manual control | Higher automation, requires testing reliability |
</Step>

<Step>
**What is version control, and why is Git used in DevOps?**  

Version control tracks code changes, allowing collaboration. Git is widely used because of:  

- **Branching & Merging** ‚Äì Parallel development  
- **Distributed Version Control** ‚Äì No central dependency  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?**  

IaC automates infrastructure provisioning using code. Example: **Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation**.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How does a DevOps engineer handle configuration management?**  

Using **Ansible, Puppet, Chef**, engineers automate configuration setup, ensuring consistency.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a container, and how does Docker help DevOps?**  

A container packages an app with dependencies, ensuring it runs identically anywhere. Docker simplifies container management.  
</Step>

<Step>
**Explain Kubernetes and why it's used in DevOps.**  

Kubernetes orchestrates containers, automating deployment, scaling, and networking.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a microservices architecture?**  

Microservices break apps into independent, loosely coupled services for scalability and agility.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a reverse proxy, and why use Nginx in DevOps?**  

A reverse proxy (e.g., **Nginx**) balances traffic, improves security, and caches content.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you monitor system performance in DevOps?**  

Using tools like **Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack** to track logs, metrics, and alerts.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the purpose of logging in DevOps?**  

Logging helps capture system and application events, allowing developers and operations teams to diagnose issues and improve performance.  

- **Tools**: ELK Stack, Loki, Splunk  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are environment variables, and why are they important in DevOps?**  

Environment variables store configuration settings (e.g., API keys, DB credentials). They help manage different environments (Dev, QA, Production) without modifying code.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a load balancer, and why is it used?**  

A **load balancer** distributes traffic across multiple servers to improve availability, reliability, and performance.  

- **Example**: Nginx, AWS ELB  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a service discovery mechanism in microservices?**  

Service discovery helps microservices locate and communicate with each other dynamically.  

- **Examples**: Consul, Eureka, Kubernetes Service Discovery  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you implement error handling in a CI/CD pipeline?**  

1. **Automated Testing** ‚Äì Detects issues early  
2. **Logging & Monitoring** ‚Äì Alerts and logs errors  
3. **Rollback Strategy** ‚Äì Deploys a stable version if errors occur
</Step>
</Steps>
