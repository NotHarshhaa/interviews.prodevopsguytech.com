# Intermediate Level

This section covers advanced concepts in DevOps, including Site Reliability Engineering, cloud computing integration, and deployment strategies.

<Steps>
<Step>
**What is Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)?**  

SRE applies software engineering principles to operations, improving reliability and scalability.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How does DevOps help in cloud computing?**  

DevOps automates infrastructure, deployments, and monitoring, making cloud environments scalable and efficient.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is Immutable Infrastructure?**  

Immutable infrastructure replaces servers instead of modifying them, ensuring consistency and reducing drift.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How does DevSecOps integrate security into DevOps?**  

DevSecOps embeds security at every stage of the DevOps lifecycle, using automated security scans and compliance checks.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are the benefits of CI/CD pipelines?**  

- Faster releases  
- Automated testing  
- Reduced manual errors  
- Enhanced collaboration  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is canary deployment?**  

Canary deployment gradually rolls out changes to a small user group before full deployment.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are some common monitoring tools?**  

Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Datadog, New Relic.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is Configuration Management in DevOps?**  

Configuration management automates infrastructure setup and maintenance. Examples: Ansible, Puppet, Chef.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is GitOps?**  

GitOps manages infrastructure using Git repositories, ensuring version control and automation.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you handle secrets management in DevOps?**  

Using tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, and Kubernetes Secrets.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is Chaos Engineering?**  

Chaos Engineering tests system resilience by introducing controlled failures.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a service mesh?**  

A service mesh manages microservices communication using proxies like Istio and Linkerd.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is an API gateway?**  

An API gateway manages API traffic, security, and load balancing.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you optimize CI/CD pipelines?**  

By parallelizing builds, caching dependencies, and using automated testing.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is hybrid cloud in DevOps?**  

A hybrid cloud combines private and public cloud environments.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is observability vs. monitoring?**  

Monitoring collects data; observability provides deeper insights into system behavior.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are Helm charts?**  

Helm charts package Kubernetes applications for easier deployment.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is A/B testing in DevOps?**  

A/B testing compares different versions of an application to determine the best performance.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you handle database schema changes in CI/CD?**  

Using tools like Flyway or Liquibase for version-controlled migrations.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is autoscaling in cloud environments?**  

Autoscaling automatically adjusts resource allocation based on demand.  
</Step>
</Steps>
