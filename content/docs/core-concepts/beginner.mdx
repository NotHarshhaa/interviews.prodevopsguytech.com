# Beginner Level

This section covers fundamental concepts of DevOps, including basic principles, practices, and essential tools.

<Steps>
<Step>
**What is DevOps?**  

DevOps is a set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration, automate workflows, and accelerate software delivery.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are the main goals of DevOps?**  

- Faster delivery of software  
- Improved collaboration between teams  
- Automation of repetitive tasks  
- Continuous feedback and improvement  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are the key components of DevOps?**  

- **CI/CD** (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
- **Monitoring and Logging**  
- **Collaboration and Communication**  
</Step>

<Step>
**How does DevOps differ from traditional IT operations?**  

DevOps focuses on automation, collaboration, and continuous feedback, whereas traditional IT operations follow a siloed approach with manual deployments and slow release cycles.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is Continuous Integration (CI)?**  

CI is a practice where developers frequently integrate code into a shared repository, followed by automated testing to detect errors early.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is Continuous Deployment (CD)?**  

CD is the automated release of validated code changes into production, ensuring rapid and reliable delivery.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?**  

IaC is managing infrastructure using code, enabling automation, consistency, and easy scalability. Examples: Terraform, CloudFormation.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is version control, and why is it important?**  

Version control tracks code changes, enabling collaboration and rollback. Example: Git.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are some popular version control tools?**  

Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Subversion (SVN).  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a DevOps pipeline?**  

A DevOps pipeline automates software delivery using stages like build, test, deploy, and monitor.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is containerization?**  

Containerization packages applications with dependencies, making them portable and consistent across environments. Example: Docker.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are microservices?**  

Microservices are small, independent services that communicate via APIs, improving scalability and maintainability.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a monolithic vs. microservices architecture?**  

Monolithic apps have a single codebase; microservices break the application into independent, loosely coupled services.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are some common DevOps automation tools?**  

- CI/CD: Jenkins, GitHub Actions  
- Configuration Management: Ansible, Puppet  
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is Shift-Left Testing?**  

Shift-left testing integrates testing early in the development cycle to detect bugs earlier.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is observability in DevOps?**  

Observability provides insights into system health using logs, metrics, and tracing.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a rollback strategy?**  

A rollback strategy reverts to a previous stable version if a new deployment fails.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the role of a DevOps Engineer?**  

A DevOps engineer bridges development and operations, focusing on automation, CI/CD, and cloud management.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are feature flags in DevOps?**  

Feature flags allow toggling features on/off without deploying new code.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a blue-green deployment?**  

Blue-green deployment maintains two environments, switching traffic between them for zero-downtime updates.  
</Step>
</Steps>
