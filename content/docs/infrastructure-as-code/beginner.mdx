# Beginner Level

This section covers fundamental concepts of Infrastructure as Code, including basic principles, tools, and essential practices.

## **Terraform Questions**  

<Steps>
<Step>
**What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and why is it important?**  

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a **method of managing and provisioning infrastructure** using code instead of manual processes. It allows:  
‚úÖ **Automation** of infrastructure deployment  
‚úÖ **Consistency** by reducing human errors  
‚úÖ **Scalability** through repeatable scripts  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is Terraform and how does it work?**  

Terraform is an **open-source IaC tool** by HashiCorp that helps define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. It follows three steps:  

1. **Write**: Define infrastructure in `.tf` files  
2. **Plan**: Preview changes before applying  
3. **Apply**: Deploy and manage resources  

Example:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the difference between Terraform and Ansible?**  

| Feature | Terraform | Ansible |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Type** | Declarative | Imperative |
| **Purpose** | Infrastructure provisioning | Configuration management |
| **State Management** | Uses state file | Stateless |
| **Example Use** | Creating VMs, Networks | Installing software, configuring OS |
</Step>

<Step>
**What are Terraform Providers?**  

Providers are **plugins** that allow Terraform to manage resources on different platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, etc.).  

Example:  

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}
```
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a Terraform State File?**  

Terraform maintains infrastructure details in a **state file (`terraform.tfstate`)**, which:  
‚úÖ Tracks existing resources  
‚úÖ Enables incremental changes  
‚úÖ Supports remote storage (e.g., S3, Azure Blob)  
</Step>
</Steps>

## **Ansible Questions**  

<Steps>
<Step>
**What is Ansible and how does it work?**  

Ansible is an **open-source configuration management tool** that automates tasks like software installation, updates, and deployments. It works **agentless**, using SSH or WinRM.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are Ansible Playbooks?**  

A playbook is a **YAML-based automation script** that defines tasks to be executed.  

Example (`playbook.yml`):  

```yaml
- name: Install Nginx
  hosts: web
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
```
</Step>

<Step>
**What is an Ansible Inventory file?**  

The inventory file **lists managed servers** and their details.  

Example (`inventory.ini`):  

```ini
[web]
server1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10
server2 ansible_host=192.168.1.11
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## **CloudFormation Questions**  

<Steps>
<Step>
**What is AWS CloudFormation?**  

AWS CloudFormation is an **IaC service** that provisions AWS infrastructure using YAML/JSON templates.  

Example:  

```yaml
Resources:
  MyBucket:
    Type: "AWS::S3::Bucket"
```
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you create a CloudFormation stack?**  

Command:  

```sh
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name my-stack --template-body file://template.yml
```
</Step>
</Steps>
