# Intermediate Level

This section covers advanced concepts in Infrastructure as Code, including state management, testing strategies, and best practices.

## **Terraform Questions**  

<Steps>
<Step>
**What is the difference between Terraform `local` and `remote` state?**  

Terraform state can be stored **locally** (on disk) or **remotely** (in S3, Consul, etc.).  

| Storage | Pros | Cons |
|---------|------|------|
| **Local State** (`terraform.tfstate`) | Fast, simple | Not suitable for teams |
| **Remote State** (S3, etc.) | Shared, secure | Slightly slower |

Example remote state (S3 backend):  

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "my-terraform-state"
    key    = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}
```
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you handle secrets in Terraform?**  

Avoid hardcoding secrets in `.tf` files:  
‚úÖ Use **environment variables**  
‚úÖ Use **Terraform Vault Provider**  
‚úÖ Store secrets in **AWS Secrets Manager**  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is Terraform Locking, and why is it important?**  

Terraform uses **state locking** to prevent simultaneous updates by multiple users.  

Example (DynamoDB locking):  

```hcl
backend "s3" {
  bucket         = "my-terraform-bucket"
  dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock"
}
```
</Step>

<Step>
**What is Terraform Workspaces?**  

Terraform **Workspaces** allow managing multiple environments within a single configuration.  

```sh
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace select dev
```
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you create reusable Terraform modules?**  

Modules help organize and reuse code.  

Example (`modules/network/main.tf`):  

```hcl
variable "vpc_cidr" {}

resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = var.vpc_cidr
}
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## **Ansible Questions**  

<Steps>
<Step>
**How do you use Ansible variables?**  

Variables can be defined in:  
‚úÖ Playbooks (`vars:`)  
‚úÖ Inventory (`host_vars`, `group_vars`)  
‚úÖ Command-line (`-e` flag)  

Example:  

```yaml
- hosts: web
  vars:
    app_port: 8080
  tasks:
    - debug: msg="App runs on port {{ app_port }}"
```
</Step>

<Step>
**What are Ansible Facts?**  

Facts are **system information** collected automatically.  

Example:  

```sh
ansible all -m setup
```
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the purpose of Ansible Handlers?**  

Handlers run **only when notified**.  

Example:  

```yaml
- name: Install Nginx
  apt:
    name: nginx
  notify: Restart Nginx

handlers:
  - name: Restart Nginx
    service:
      name: nginx
      state: restarted
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## **CloudFormation Questions**

<Steps>
<Step>
**What are the main components of AWS CloudFormation?**  

| Component | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| **Templates** | Defines resources in YAML/JSON |
| **Stacks** | Collection of AWS resources |
| **StackSets** | Deploy stacks across multiple accounts |
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you update a CloudFormation stack?**  

Use:  

```sh
aws cloudformation update-stack --stack-name my-stack --template-body file://template.yml
```
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the difference between `DependsOn` and `CreationPolicy` in CloudFormation?**  

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `DependsOn` | Ensures a resource is created before another |
| `CreationPolicy` | Waits for a signal before marking as successful |
</Step>
</Steps>
