# Advanced Level

This section covers expert-level concepts in automation and scripting, including advanced debugging techniques, signal handling, remote execution, and complex pipeline configurations.

<Steps>
<Step>
**How do you debug a Bash script?**

Use `set -x` for debugging:  

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -x
echo "Debugging mode enabled"
```
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you trap signals in a Bash script?**

```bash
trap "echo 'Script interrupted'; exit" SIGINT SIGTERM
```

Catches `Ctrl+C` (SIGINT) and terminates gracefully.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the difference between `$(command)` and backticks `` `command` `` in Bash?**

Both execute commands, but `$(command)` is preferred as it's **nestable**.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you handle multiline commands in a Bash script?**

Use `\` for line continuation:  

```bash
echo "This is a \
multiline command"
```
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you use conditionals inside a YAML file?**

With Jinja2 templating in Ansible:  

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Install package
    yum:
      name: httpd
    when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
```
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you encrypt secrets in YAML?**

Use **Ansible Vault**:  

```bash
ansible-vault encrypt secrets.yaml
```
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you execute a Python script inside a Bash script?**

```bash
python3 <<EOF
print("Hello from Python")
EOF
```
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the difference between `continue` and `break` in Bash loops?**

- `break` exits the loop entirely.  
- `continue` skips the current iteration.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you parse a JSON file in Bash?**

Use `jq`:  

```bash
cat data.json | jq '.key'
```
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you use arrays in Groovy?**

```groovy
def arr = ["a", "b", "c"]
println arr[0]
```
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a Jenkins shared library in Groovy?**

A reusable **pipeline function** stored in Git.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you set a timeout for a script in Bash?**

```bash
timeout 10s ./script.sh
```
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you execute a Bash function in a subshell?**

```bash
(my_function)
```

Runs in a new shell, not affecting the parent script.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you use Python to send an HTTP request?**

```python
import requests
response = requests.get("https://example.com")
print(response.text)
```
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you handle authentication in a Python script?**

```python
import requests
requests.get("https://example.com", auth=("user", "pass"))
```
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you find and replace text in YAML files?**

Use `yq`:  

```bash
yq e '.name="NewValue"' -i config.yaml
```
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you define a multi-stage Jenkins pipeline in Groovy?**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') { steps { echo "Building..." } }
        stage('Test') { steps { echo "Testing..." } }
    }
}
```
</Step>

<Step>
**What is an inline script in a CI/CD pipeline?**

Running a script **directly inside a pipeline** (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).  
Example in GitHub Actions:  

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      - run: echo "Inline script execution"
```
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you execute a script remotely via SSH in Bash?**

```bash
ssh user@server 'bash -s' < local_script.sh
```
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you ensure idempotency in an Ansible playbook?**

Ansible modules ensure **idempotency** by only making changes when needed. 
</Step>
