# Beginner Level

This section covers fundamental concepts in automation and scripting, including basic Bash commands, Python scripting, YAML syntax, and introductory Groovy concepts.

<Steps>
<Step>
**What is automation in DevOps?**

Automation in DevOps refers to scripting repetitive tasks like provisioning, configuration, deployment, and monitoring to improve efficiency and reduce errors.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are the benefits of scripting in DevOps?**

- Reduces manual effort  
- Increases consistency and repeatability  
- Improves efficiency and speed  
- Reduces errors and enhances security  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is Bash scripting?**

Bash scripting is writing command-line instructions in a script file (`.sh`) to automate tasks in Unix/Linux environments.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you write a basic Bash script?**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, DevOps!"
```

Save the file (`script.sh`), make it executable (`chmod +x script.sh`), and run it (`./script.sh`).  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the difference between Bash and Shell scripting?**

Bash is a type of shell, but shell scripting can also be done in other shells like **sh, csh, and zsh**. Bash provides more advanced scripting features.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are variables in Bash?**

Variables store values and are defined without a `$` sign but accessed using `$`.  

```bash
name="DevOps"
echo "Hello, $name"
```
</Step>

<Step>
**What is Python scripting used for in DevOps?**

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)  
- CI/CD automation  
- Log analysis  
- Cloud automation (AWS, Azure, GCP SDKs)  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you define a function in Python?**

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, DevOps!")
greet()
```
</Step>

<Step>
**What is YAML, and where is it used?**

YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) is a human-readable format used for **Kubernetes configurations, Ansible playbooks, CI/CD pipelines**, etc.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a YAML file example?**

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
```
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you write a simple Groovy script?**

```groovy
println "Hello, DevOps!"
```

Groovy is used in **Jenkins pipelines and automation tasks**.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the shebang (`#!`) in a script?**

The shebang (`#!/bin/bash` or `#!/usr/bin/python3`) specifies the interpreter for executing the script.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are loops in Bash?**

Bash supports `for`, `while`, and `until` loops. Example:  

```bash
for i in {1..5}; do echo "Iteration $i"; done
```
</Step>

<Step>
**What are conditional statements in Bash?**

`if-else` statements execute different code based on conditions.  

```bash
if [ $USER == "root" ]; then echo "Admin access"; else echo "User access"; fi
```
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you read input in Bash?**

```bash
echo "Enter name: "
read name
echo "Hello, $name"
```
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you create a Python virtual environment?**

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
```
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you parse JSON in Python?**

```python
import json
data = '{"name": "DevOps"}'
parsed = json.loads(data)
print(parsed["name"])
```
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the `awk` command in Bash?**

`awk` is used for text processing. Example:  

```bash
awk '{print $1}' file.txt
```

Extracts the first column from `file.txt`.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you comment in YAML?**

Use `#` for comments.  

```yaml
# This is a comment
name: DevOps
```
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you declare variables in Groovy?**

```groovy
def name = "DevOps"
println name
```
</Step>
</Steps>
