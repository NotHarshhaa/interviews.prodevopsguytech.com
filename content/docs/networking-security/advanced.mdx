# Advanced Level

This section covers expert-level networking and security concepts commonly asked in interviews for senior professionals.

<Steps>

<Step>
### What is mutual TLS (mTLS), and why is it used?

Mutual TLS (mTLS) ensures **both client and server** authenticate each other before communication, enhancing security in microservices and API interactions.
</Step>

<Step>
### What is the difference between L3, L4, and L7 firewalls?

- **L3 Firewall (Network Layer)**: Filters traffic based on IP addresses.  
- **L4 Firewall (Transport Layer)**: Filters based on ports and TCP/UDP protocols.  
- **L7 Firewall (Application Layer)**: Filters based on application-specific data (e.g., HTTP, FTP).
</Step>

<Step>
### How does AWS Security Groups differ from Network ACLs?

- **Security Groups**: Act as virtual firewalls at the instance level, stateful.  
- **Network ACLs**: Act at the subnet level, stateless.
</Step>

<Step>
### What is a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system?

SIEM aggregates security data from multiple sources to detect, analyze, and respond to threats.
</Step>

<Step>
### What is a threat model in security?

Threat modeling identifies potential threats and vulnerabilities in a system to proactively mitigate risks.
</Step>

<Step>
### What is an ephemeral port, and how is it used?

Ephemeral ports (e.g., **49152-65535**) are temporary ports used by client applications for outbound connections.
</Step>

<Step>
### How does DNSSEC enhance DNS security?

DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) prevents DNS spoofing by adding cryptographic signatures to DNS records.
</Step>

<Step>
### What are the different types of VPNs?

- **Remote Access VPN** (for individuals connecting to a network remotely).  
- **Site-to-Site VPN** (connects entire networks).
</Step>

<Step>
### How does a service mesh improve security in Kubernetes?

A **service mesh** (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) provides **mTLS, authentication, and observability** for secure communication between microservices.
</Step>

<Step>
### What are some common OWASP Top 10 security risks?

1. Injection (e.g., SQL injection)  
2. Broken Authentication  
3. Sensitive Data Exposure  
4. XML External Entities (XXE)  
5. Broken Access Control  
6. Security Misconfiguration  
7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
8. Insecure Deserialization  
9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities  
10. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring
</Step>

<Step>
### How do WebSockets handle security concerns?

WebSockets require **authentication, encryption (WSS), and proper origin checks** to prevent attacks.
</Step>

<Step>
### What is an SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) attack?

An SSRF attack tricks a server into making requests to internal services, leading to data leaks or system compromise.
</Step>

<Step>
### How does an AWS WAF protect applications?

AWS WAF filters web traffic based on **rules, rate limiting, and bot mitigation** to prevent common attacks like SQL injection and XSS.
</Step>

<Step>
### How does Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) work?

Kubernetes RBAC grants permissions based on **Roles, RoleBindings, ClusterRoles, and ClusterRoleBindings**, restricting access to resources.
</Step>

<Step>
### What is a MAC address, and how does MAC filtering enhance security?

A MAC address is a **unique identifier** for network interfaces. MAC filtering allows or denies network access based on these addresses.
</Step>

<Step>
### How does DNS poisoning work, and how can it be prevented?

DNS poisoning tricks users into visiting **malicious sites** by altering DNS records. Prevention includes **DNSSEC, monitoring, and secure DNS resolvers**.
</Step>

<Step>
### What is a federated identity in security?

Federated identity allows users to authenticate across multiple applications using a **single set of credentials** (e.g., Google or Microsoft sign-in).
</Step>

<Step>
### How does Kubernetes Network Policy improve security?

Kubernetes Network Policies define **rules for pod communication**, restricting traffic based on namespaces, labels, and IP ranges.
</Step>

<Step>
### What is the principle of least privilege (PoLP)?

PoLP ensures **users and applications only have the minimum access** needed to perform their tasks, reducing security risks.
</Step>

<Step>
### How do HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) and CSP (Content Security Policy) improve web security?

- **HSTS**: Forces HTTPS connections to prevent downgrade attacks.  
- **CSP**: Restricts allowed content sources to prevent XSS attacks.
</Step>

</Steps>
