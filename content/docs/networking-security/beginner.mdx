# Beginner Level

This section covers fundamental networking and security concepts commonly asked in entry-level interviews.

## **üöÄ Beginner-Level Questions**  

<Steps>
<Step>
**What is a network?**  

A network is a group of interconnected devices that communicate to share resources and information. It can be wired or wireless.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is an IP address?**  

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to each device on a network to facilitate communication.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?**  

- **IPv4**: 32-bit addressing, supports 4.3 billion addresses.  
- **IPv6**: 128-bit addressing, supports an enormous number of addresses, improving scalability and security.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are private and public IP addresses?**  

- **Private IPs**: Used within local networks (e.g., 192.168.x.x).  
- **Public IPs**: Used on the internet and assigned by ISPs.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a subnet mask?**  

A subnet mask divides an IP address into network and host portions, determining which part identifies the network and which part identifies the device.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is DHCP, and how does it work?**  

The **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** automatically assigns IP addresses to devices in a network, reducing manual configuration.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is DNS, and why is it important?**  

The **Domain Name System (DNS)** translates domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses, making it easier to access websites.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is NAT (Network Address Translation)?**  

NAT allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address for internet access.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a firewall?**  

A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are the types of firewalls?**  

- **Packet Filtering Firewall**  
- **Stateful Inspection Firewall**  
- **Proxy Firewall**  
- **Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)**  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a VPN?**  

A **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** encrypts internet connections, providing secure remote access and anonymity.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is SSH, and why is it used?**  

SSH (**Secure Shell**) is a protocol used for secure remote access to servers using encrypted communication.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is HTTP and HTTPS?**  

- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: Unencrypted web communication.  
- **HTTPS (HTTP Secure)**: Secure, encrypted communication using SSL/TLS.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is an SSL/TLS certificate?**  

An SSL/TLS certificate encrypts website traffic, ensuring secure communication and trustworthiness.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a load balancer?**  

A load balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to optimize performance and availability.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are different types of load balancers?**  

- **Layer 4 Load Balancer** (Transport Layer)  
- **Layer 7 Load Balancer** (Application Layer)  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a DMZ in networking?**  

A **Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)** is a security buffer between an internal network and the internet, hosting public-facing services securely.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is port forwarding?**  

Port forwarding redirects network traffic from one port to another, often used to expose internal services externally.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)?**  

ARP translates IP addresses into MAC addresses to enable communication within a local network.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is an IDS and IPS?**  

- **IDS (Intrusion Detection System)**: Monitors network traffic for threats.  
- **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)**: Blocks malicious traffic automatically.  
</Step>
</Steps>
