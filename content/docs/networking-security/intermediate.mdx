# Intermediate Level

This section covers advanced networking and security concepts commonly asked in interviews for experienced professionals.

## **üöÄ Intermediate-Level Questions**  

<Steps>
<Step>
**What is Zero Trust Security?**  

Zero Trust is a security model that assumes no entity (inside or outside the network) is trusted by default.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?**  

- **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses one key for encryption and decryption.  
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses a public-private key pair (e.g., RSA).  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a CDN (Content Delivery Network)?**  

A **CDN** improves website speed and security by distributing content across multiple servers worldwide.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the difference between TCP and UDP?**  

- **TCP**: Reliable, connection-oriented, ensures data delivery.  
- **UDP**: Faster, connectionless, best for real-time applications.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How does a reverse proxy improve security?**  

A reverse proxy sits between users and backend servers, protecting them from direct exposure and filtering malicious traffic.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are the benefits of HTTPS over HTTP?**  

- Encryption  
- Data integrity  
- Authentication  
</Step>

<Step>
**How does multi-factor authentication (MFA) enhance security?**  

MFA adds an extra security layer by requiring multiple verification methods (e.g., password + OTP).  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a bastion host?**  

A **bastion host** is a highly secured jump server used to access internal networks securely.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is OSI Model and its layers?**  

The OSI model has **7 layers**: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a WAF (Web Application Firewall)?**  

A **WAF** protects web applications by filtering and blocking malicious HTTP traffic.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a honeypot in cybersecurity?**  

A honeypot is a security system designed to detect and study cyberattacks by mimicking real systems.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)?**  

BGP is a routing protocol used for exchanging routing information between networks on the internet.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is DDoS, and how can it be mitigated?**  

A **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)** attack overwhelms a system. It can be mitigated using:

- Rate limiting
- Firewalls
- Cloud-based protection
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the CIA Triad in security?**  

The **CIA Triad** stands for **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**, which are fundamental security principles.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is SSO (Single Sign-On)?**  

SSO allows users to log in to multiple applications using a single authentication process.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a security token?**  

A **security token** is a physical or digital device used for authentication.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is an access control list (ACL)?**  

An ACL defines rules that allow or deny traffic based on IP, ports, or protocols.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a container network security concern?**  

Containers share OS kernels, so misconfigurations can expose services to security threats.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is network segmentation?**  

It is dividing a network into smaller parts to improve security and performance.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the difference between active and passive reconnaissance?**  

- **Active reconnaissance**: Direct interaction with the target.  
- **Passive reconnaissance**: Collecting data without direct interaction.  
</Step>
</Steps>
