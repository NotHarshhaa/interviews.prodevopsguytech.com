# Advanced Level

This section covers expert-level monitoring and logging concepts commonly asked in interviews for senior professionals.

## **üöÄ Advanced-Level Monitoring & Logging Questions**  

#### *(Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack)*  

<Steps>
<Step>
**How do you scale Prometheus for a large environment?**  

Prometheus is a **single-node** system, so for large environments:  

- **Use multiple Prometheus instances** scraping different targets.  
- **Federation:** Create a parent Prometheus that scrapes **aggregated** metrics from child Prometheus instances.  
- **Remote storage:** Use **Thanos, Cortex, or Mimir** to store metrics in scalable object storage (S3, GCS).  
- **Sharding:** Distribute scraping targets across Prometheus instances using load balancing tools like **Kube StatefulSets**.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How does Prometheus handle stale or missing metrics?**  

- **Stale markers:** Prometheus marks time-series data as **stale** if a target stops reporting metrics.  
- **Absent function (`absent()`)**: Used in PromQL to detect missing metrics.  
- **Dead Man's Switch**: A constant alert (e.g., `ALWAYS_ON`) ensures the alerting system is functional.  

Example:  

```
absent(up{job="my_service"})
```

Triggers an alert if `up{job="my_service"}` is missing.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is Prometheus WAL (Write-Ahead Log) and its purpose?**  

The **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)** in Prometheus:  

- **Stores data on disk before committing it to TSDB (Time-Series Database).**  
- Reduces data loss during crashes.  
- WAL files are stored in **/data/wal/** and help recover metrics quickly after a restart.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are Histogram and Summary metrics in Prometheus?**  

Both are used for measuring **latency and response time**:  

- **Histogram:** Buckets data into **predefined ranges**, allowing percentiles to be calculated later.  
- **Summary:** Precomputes percentiles but cannot be aggregated across instances.  

Example (Histogram metric):  

```
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
```

This calculates the **95th percentile response time**.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you secure Prometheus endpoints?**  

- **Enable authentication & TLS** via a reverse proxy (Nginx, Traefik).  
- **Use RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** in Kubernetes for limiting access.  
- **Set up network policies** to restrict Prometheus access.  

Example: Using basic auth with Nginx:  

```nginx
server {
  listen 9090;
  location / {
    auth_basic "Restricted";
    auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
  }
}
```
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you monitor Prometheus itself using Grafana?**  

- Enable the built-in Prometheus **self-metrics endpoint (`/metrics`)**.  
- Use dashboards to monitor **scrape latency, TSDB memory usage, query duration**.  
- Use the **Prometheus Federation API** to get meta-metrics.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are Grafana Annotations and how are they useful?**  

Annotations mark **events (deployments, incidents, downtimes)** on Grafana graphs for better visualization.  
Example: Mark a **Kubernetes deployment** event in Grafana.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you configure Grafana for multi-tenancy?**  

- **Organizations:** Create multiple teams with separate dashboards.  
- **Data source permissions:** Restrict access at the **data-source level**.  
- **Multi-instance deployment:** Run **separate Grafana instances** for different teams.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is Alerting in Grafana and how does it work?**  

- **Grafana alerts** monitor query conditions.  
- Alert states: **OK, Pending, Alerting, No Data**.  
- **Notification channels:** Slack, PagerDuty, Email, Webhooks.  

Example Grafana alert condition:  

- `avg(http_requests_total) > 1000` ‚Üí Sends an alert if requests exceed 1000.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How does Loki compare with Elasticsearch for logging?**  

| Feature  | Loki | Elasticsearch |  
|----------|------|--------------|  
| Storage  | Compressed logs | Full-text index |  
| Querying | Label-based | Query DSL |  
| Performance | Faster (optimized for Kubernetes) | Heavy resource usage |  

**Loki is recommended for lightweight, Kubernetes-native logging**, while **Elasticsearch is better for complex log analysis**.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the Hot-Warm-Cold architecture in Elasticsearch?**  

This strategy optimizes storage cost:  

- **Hot Nodes** ‚Üí Store recent, frequently queried data.  
- **Warm Nodes** ‚Üí Store older logs with infrequent access.  
- **Cold Nodes** ‚Üí Store archived logs for long-term retention.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you reduce indexing pressure in Elasticsearch?**  

- **Use ILM (Index Lifecycle Management).**  
- **Optimize shard count** (Avoid too many small shards).  
- **Increase refresh intervals (`index.refresh_interval: 30s`).**  
</Step>

<Step>
**How does Logstash manage backpressure?**  

- **Persistent Queues** ‚Üí Buffer data before sending to Elasticsearch.  
- **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** ‚Üí Stores failed events for reprocessing.  

Example:  

```yaml
queue.type: persisted
queue.max_bytes: 1gb
```
</Step>

<Step>
**What are Query Caching strategies in Elasticsearch?**  

- **Request cache:** Stores query results.  
- **Shard request cache:** Caches **aggregations and filters**.  
- **Doc value cache:** Optimizes **sorting and aggregations**.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you use Kibana for anomaly detection?**  

- **Machine Learning Jobs** ‚Üí Identify unusual trends in logs.  
- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** ‚Üí Detect security threats.  

Example anomaly detection job:  

```json
{
  "analysis_config": {
    "bucket_span": "15m",
    "detectors": [{ "function": "mean", "field_name": "cpu_usage" }]
  }
}
```
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you secure Elasticsearch clusters?**  

- **Enable TLS (`xpack.security.enabled: true`).**  
- **Use API Key authentication.**  
- **Implement firewall rules to restrict access.**  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you integrate Prometheus with Elasticsearch?**  

Use **Metricbeat** with the Prometheus module to collect metrics and store them in Elasticsearch. This allows you to:

- **Visualize Prometheus metrics** in Kibana
- **Combine metrics with logs** for better correlation
- **Use Elasticsearch's powerful search capabilities** on metric data
</Step>
</Steps>
