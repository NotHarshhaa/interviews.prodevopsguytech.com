# Intermediate Level

This section covers advanced concepts in CI/CD, including pipeline optimization, deployment strategies, and integration with various tools and services.

<Steps>
<Step>
**How do you implement security scanning in a CI/CD pipeline?**

Security scanning implementation includes:
- SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
- Dependency scanning
- Container security scanning
</Step>

<Step>
**What are Jenkins pipelines and how do they work?**

Jenkins pipelines are defined using Jenkinsfile and provide:
- Declarative or scripted syntax
- Stage-based workflow definition
- Pipeline as code
- Reusable components
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you handle database migrations in CI/CD?**

Database migration strategies include:
- Version control for schema changes
- Automated migration scripts
- Rollback mechanisms
- Zero-downtime migrations
</Step>

<Step>
**What is GitOps and how does it relate to CI/CD?**

GitOps principles include:
- Git as single source of truth
- Declarative infrastructure
- Automated synchronization
- Version-controlled operations
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you implement blue-green deployments?**

Blue-green deployment process:
1. Maintain two identical environments
2. Route traffic between versions
3. Test new version
4. Switch traffic if successful
5. Keep old version as backup
</Step>

<Step>
**What are the best practices for CI/CD pipeline security?**

Security best practices include:
- Secrets management
- Least privilege access
- Artifact signing
- Vulnerability scanning
- Compliance checks
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you handle configuration management in CI/CD?**

Configuration management approaches:
- Environment-specific configs
- Configuration as code
- Secret management
- Feature flags
</Step>

<Step>
**What is container orchestration in CI/CD?**

Container orchestration involves:
- Managing container lifecycle
- Scaling applications
- Service discovery
- Load balancing
- Rolling updates
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you implement automated testing in CI/CD?**

Automated testing implementation:
- Test pyramids
- Parallel test execution
- Test environment management
- Test result reporting
- Coverage analysis
</Step>

<Step>
**What is infrastructure as code (IaC) in CI/CD?**

IaC implementation includes:
- Template-based provisioning
- Version-controlled infrastructure
- Automated deployment
- Environment consistency
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you handle dependencies in CI/CD?**

Dependency management includes:
- Version locking
- Dependency scanning
- Cache management
- Artifact repositories
- Vulnerability checking
</Step>

<Step>
**What are CI/CD metrics and how do you track them?**

Key metrics include:
- Deployment frequency
- Lead time
- Change failure rate
- Mean time to recovery
- Pipeline velocity
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you implement canary deployments?**

Canary deployment process:
1. Deploy to subset of users
2. Monitor performance
3. Gather feedback
4. Gradual rollout
5. Rollback capability
</Step>

<Step>
**What is trunk-based development in CI/CD?**

Trunk-based development involves:
- Short-lived feature branches
- Frequent integration
- Feature flags
- Automated testing
- Continuous deployment
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you handle rollbacks in CI/CD?**

Rollback strategies include:
- Automated rollback triggers
- Version control for artifacts

</Step>

<Step>
**What is continuous testing in CI/CD?**

Continuous testing involves:
- Automated test suites
- Test environment management
- Performance testing
- Security testing
- Integration testing
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you manage secrets in CI/CD pipelines?**

Secrets management includes:
- Vault integration
