# Advanced Level

This section covers expert-level CI/CD practices and implementation strategies.

<Steps>
<Step>
**What are self-hosted runners in CI/CD?**  

Self-hosted runners are custom machines for executing CI/CD jobs instead of cloud-hosted ones.  

- Example: GitHub Actions supports **Linux, Windows, macOS** runners.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How does caching improve CI/CD performance?**  

Caching stores **dependencies** and **artifacts** to speed up builds.  

- Example: Caching npm dependencies in GitHub Actions:  

  ```yaml
  steps:
    - uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: ~/.npm
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
  ```  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is parallel execution in CI/CD?**  

Parallel execution runs multiple tasks **simultaneously** to speed up pipelines.  

- Example: Running multiple tests at once in Jenkins.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is dynamic vs. static analysis in CI/CD security?**  

- **Static Analysis:** Scans code **before execution** (e.g., SonarQube).  
- **Dynamic Analysis:** Scans code **during runtime** (e.g., OWASP ZAP).  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a feature flag, and how does it work in CI/CD?**  

A feature flag enables/disables features without deploying new code.  

- Example: Toggle dark mode using a flag instead of redeploying.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you handle secrets in CI/CD pipelines?**  

- Use **environment variables** securely.  
- Store secrets in **AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault**.  
- Example:  

  ```yaml
  secrets:
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
  ```  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is observability in CI/CD?**  

Observability means **monitoring logs, metrics, and traces** to debug CI/CD failures.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is immutable infrastructure?**  

Immutable infrastructure means **servers are never updated** but replaced instead.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are the key metrics for CI/CD performance?**  

- **Lead Time:** Time from commit to deployment.  
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR):** Time to recover from failures.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you ensure zero-downtime deployments?**  

- **Use rolling updates, blue-green, and canary deployments.**  
- **Deploy with Kubernetes and load balancers.**  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a release train in CI/CD?**  

A **release train** is a deployment strategy where software releases are scheduled at **fixed intervals**, rather than waiting for all features to be ready.  

- Common in **Agile** environments.  
- Ensures **predictability** and **reduces deployment risks**.  
- Example: **Google Chrome** releases every 4 weeks regardless of pending features.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you handle database migrations in a CI/CD pipeline?**  

Database migrations ensure **schema changes** are applied safely in an automated pipeline.  

- Use tools like **Liquibase, Flyway, Django Migrations**.  
- Steps in CI/CD:  
  1. **Check migrations** before deployment (`liquibase validate`).  
  2. **Apply migrations** during deployment (`flyway migrate`).  
  3. **Rollback if failure** (`flyway undo`).  
- Example in a pipeline (Flyway):  

  ```yaml
  steps:
    - name: Apply database migrations
      run: flyway migrate -url=jdbc:mysql://db -user=root -password=secret
  ```  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is trunk-based development, and how does it impact CI/CD?**  

Trunk-based development means developers **commit directly to the main branch** (trunk) instead of using long-lived feature branches.  

- **Pros:**  
  - **Faster CI/CD cycles** with fewer merge conflicts.  
  - Reduces integration complexity.  
- **Cons:**  
  - Requires **strict automated testing** to prevent breaking changes.  
- Example workflow:  
  - Commit to `main` → Automated Tests → Deploy to Staging → Deploy to Production.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you implement blue-green deployments in Kubernetes?**  

A **blue-green deployment** runs **two versions** of an application simultaneously, allowing **instant rollback** if issues occur.  

- Steps:  
  1. Deploy **new version (green)** while **old version (blue) stays live**.  
  2. Switch traffic to green using a **load balancer or Ingress**.  
  3. Rollback if issues arise by redirecting traffic back to blue.  
- Example Kubernetes YAML:  

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Ingress
  metadata:
    name: blue-green
  spec:
    rules:
      - http:
          paths:
            - path: "/"
              backend:
                service:
                  name: green-service
                  port:
                    number: 80
  ```  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a service mesh, and how does it help CI/CD?**  

A **service mesh** is a dedicated infrastructure layer for handling **service-to-service communication** in microservices.  

- Examples: **Istio, Linkerd, Consul**.  
- Benefits in CI/CD:  
  - **Canary deployments**: Route traffic gradually.  
  - **A/B Testing**: Split traffic between versions.  
  - **Security**: Implements zero-trust policies (e.g., **mTLS**).  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is progressive delivery in CI/CD?**  

Progressive delivery is an **evolution of CI/CD** that deploys features gradually, rather than all at once.  

- **Includes:**  
  - **Feature Flags:** Enable/disable features dynamically.  
  - **Canary Releases:** Test with a small user group first.  
  - **A/B Testing:** Deploy different versions for analytics.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you handle long-running tests in CI/CD pipelines?**  

Long-running tests slow down deployments. Strategies to optimize:  

- **Parallel Test Execution:** Run tests across multiple machines.  
- **Test Selection:** Run only impacted tests using **test impact analysis**.  
- **Mocking Dependencies:** Reduce external calls using **Mockito, WireMock**.  
- **Shift-Left Testing:** Run tests **early in the pipeline** to detect failures faster.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is Chaos Engineering, and how does it fit into CI/CD?**  

Chaos Engineering involves **intentionally injecting failures** to test system resilience.  

- **Example tools:**  
  - **Gremlin, LitmusChaos** (Kubernetes-based).  
  - **AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS)**.  
- **In CI/CD Pipelines:**  
  - Add a **chaos test stage** before production deployment.  
  - Example:  

    ```yaml
    steps:
      - name: Run Chaos Test
        run: gremlin attack --target kubernetes --cpu 90%
    ```  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you implement immutable deployments in CI/CD?**  

Immutable deployments mean **never modifying running instances**—instead, deploying a new version entirely.  

- Best for **containers, serverless, and cloud-native applications**.  
- Tools:  
  - **Docker images** (`image: my-app:v2`).  
  - **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)** to replace instances.  
- **Example:**  
  - **Bad approach:** `ssh into a server & update the app`.  
  - **Good approach:** `Deploy a new container & replace old one`.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are the best practices for securing CI/CD pipelines?**  

To secure CI/CD, follow **these best practices**:  
✅ **Use Secret Management:** Store secrets in **Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Kubernetes Secrets**.  
✅ **Enable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Restrict who can trigger deployments.  
✅ **Enforce Code Signing:** Sign artifacts to ensure they are not tampered with.  
✅ **Run Security Scans:** Use **SAST, DAST, and dependency scanning** tools.  
✅ **Monitor CI/CD Pipelines:** Detect suspicious activity using **SIEM tools** like Splunk or Datadog.
