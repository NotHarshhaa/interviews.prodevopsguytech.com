# Beginner Level

This section covers fundamental concepts of CI/CD, including basic principles, tools, and common practices.

<Steps>
<Step>
**What is CI/CD?**

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment:
- **Continuous Integration**: Automatically integrating code changes into a shared repository
- **Continuous Delivery**: Automating the delivery of applications to selected environments
- **Continuous Deployment**: Automatically deploying all code changes to production
</Step>

<Step>
**What are the key components of a CI/CD pipeline?**

- Source Control (e.g., Git)
- Build Tools
- Test Automation
- Deployment Tools
- Monitoring Systems
</Step>

<Step>
**What is Jenkins and what is it used for?**

Jenkins is an open-source automation server used to build, test, and deploy software. It provides:
- Pipeline automation
- Plugin ecosystem
- Build automation
- Deployment tools
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment?**

- **Continuous Delivery**: Changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for release but require manual approval for deployment
- **Continuous Deployment**: Changes automatically go through the pipeline and into production without manual intervention
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a build pipeline?**

A build pipeline is a set of automated processes that:
- Compiles code
- Runs tests
- Creates artifacts
- Prepares for deployment
</Step>

<Step>
**What is version control and why is it important in CI/CD?**

Version control (e.g., Git) tracks changes to source code and enables:
- Collaboration
- Code history
- Branch management
- Conflict resolution
</Step>

<Step>
**What are the basic stages in a CI/CD pipeline?**

1. Source (Code checkout)
2. Build
3. Test
4. Package
5. Deploy
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a Dockerfile and why is it important in CI/CD?**

A Dockerfile is a script containing instructions to build a Docker image. It's important because it:
- Ensures consistent environments
- Enables containerization
- Simplifies deployment
</Step>

<Step>
**What is automated testing in CI/CD?**

Automated testing includes:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Functional tests
- Performance tests
Running automatically when code changes are pushed.
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a build artifact?**

A build artifact is the output of a build process, such as:
- Compiled code
- Container images
- Documentation
- Package files
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a webhook in CI/CD?**

A webhook is an automated notification that:
- Triggers pipeline events
- Integrates different tools
- Enables automated workflows
</Step>

<Step>
**What is environment configuration in CI/CD?**

Environment configuration includes:
- Server settings
- Database connections
- API endpoints
- Environment variables
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a build trigger?**

A build trigger is an event that starts a CI/CD pipeline, such as:
- Code commits
- Pull requests
- Scheduled builds
- Manual triggers
</Step>

<Step>
**What are environment variables in CI/CD?**

Environment variables store configuration data like:
- API keys
- Database credentials
- Service endpoints
- Build configurations
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a deployment strategy?**

Basic deployment strategies include:
- Rolling updates
- Blue-green deployment
- Canary releases
- Feature flags
</Step>

<Step>
**What is source code management (SCM)?**

SCM tools (like Git) provide:
- Version control
- Branch management
- Collaboration features
- Code history
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a build agent/node?**

A build agent/node is a machine that:
- Executes pipeline tasks
- Runs builds
- Performs tests
- Handles deployments
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a pipeline as code?**

Pipeline as code means:
- Defining pipelines in code
- Version controlling pipeline configurations
- Treating pipeline config as part of the application
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a build status?**

Build status indicates pipeline state:
- Success
- Failure
- In Progress
- Cancelled
</Step>

<Step>
**What are artifacts repositories?**

Artifact repositories store build outputs like:
- Binary files
- Container images
- Documentation
- Dependencies 
</Step>
