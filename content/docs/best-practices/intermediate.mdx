# Intermediate Level

This section covers more advanced concepts in DevOps best practices, including configuration management, high availability, security, and microservices architecture.

<Steps>
<Step>
**How do you handle configuration management in DevOps?**  

Using tools like Ansible, Puppet, and Chef to automate configurations.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you ensure high availability in a cloud-based architecture?**  

Using load balancing, auto-scaling, multi-region deployments, and failover mechanisms.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the difference between monolithic and microservices architectures?**  

- **Monolithic**: A single large application.  
- **Microservices**: Independent services communicating over APIs.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you monitor microservices effectively?**  

Using distributed tracing (Jaeger), centralized logging (ELK), and service mesh (Istio).  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you secure a CI/CD pipeline?**  

- Use least privilege access.  
- Store secrets securely.  
- Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities.  
- Implement code signing.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are some common DevOps anti-patterns?**  

- Siloed teams  
- Manual deployments  
- Lack of monitoring  
- Ignoring security  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you implement DevSecOps?**  

Integrate security into every stage of development using tools like SonarQube, Snyk, and Trivy.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a Service Level Agreement (SLA)?**  

An SLA defines the expected level of service, including uptime and response times.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you ensure compliance in DevOps?**  

By automating security checks, auditing, and following regulatory frameworks like GDPR and SOC 2.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a chaos engineering experiment?**  

Intentionally injecting failures into a system to test its resilience (e.g., Netflix's Chaos Monkey).  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you reduce deployment downtime?**  

Using rolling updates, blue-green deployments, and zero-downtime migrations.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you handle database migrations in CI/CD?**  

Using tools like Flyway, Liquibase, or Django migrations in an automated pipeline.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is an API gateway, and why is it used?**  

An API gateway manages API requests, security, and load balancing in microservices.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you implement infrastructure testing?**  

Using tools like **Terratest** (for Terraform), **InSpec**, and **Pester**.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you manage multi-cloud deployments?**  

Using **Terraform**, **Kubernetes**, and **cloud-agnostic tools** like HashiCorp Vault and Istio.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the difference between SLO and SLI?**  

- **SLO (Service Level Objective)**: A target level of reliability (e.g., 99.9% uptime).  
- **SLI (Service Level Indicator)**: A measurable metric (e.g., response time < 200ms).  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you manage dependencies in DevOps?**  

Using dependency managers like **pip, npm, Maven**, and **scanning tools like Snyk and OWASP Dependency-Check**.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you handle rollback in a Kubernetes environment?**  

Using `kubectl rollout undo deployment <deployment_name>`.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are the best practices for writing Dockerfiles?**  

- Use lightweight base images.  
- Minimize layers.  
- Avoid hardcoding secrets.  
- Use multi-stage builds.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is FinOps in cloud computing?**  

A practice for optimizing cloud costs and budgeting efficiently. 
</Step>
