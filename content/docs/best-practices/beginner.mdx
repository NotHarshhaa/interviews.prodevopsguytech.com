# Beginner Level

This section covers fundamental best practices in DevOps, including infrastructure as code, CI/CD, monitoring, and basic deployment strategies.

<Steps>
<Step>
**What are DevOps best practices?**  

Key DevOps best practices include:  

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)  
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)  
- Monitoring and Logging  
- Automated Testing  
- Security as Code  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the purpose of Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?**  

IaC enables automated and consistent provisioning of infrastructure using tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, and Ansible.  
</Step>

<Step>
**Why is version control important in DevOps?**  

Version control (e.g., Git) helps track changes, collaborate effectively, and rollback if needed.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is Continuous Integration (CI)?**  

CI is the practice of frequently merging code changes into a shared repository and automatically testing them.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are the key components of a CI/CD pipeline?**  

- Code commit  
- Build  
- Test  
- Deploy  
- Monitor  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the difference between Continuous Deployment and Continuous Delivery?**  

- **Continuous Delivery**: Automated testing, but manual deployment approval.  
- **Continuous Deployment**: Fully automated release process.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the importance of automated testing in DevOps?**  

Automated testing ensures code quality, catches bugs early, and speeds up deployment.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the purpose of monitoring in DevOps?**  

Monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK) track system performance and detect issues in real-time.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are blue-green deployments?**  

A deployment strategy where two environments (blue & green) run simultaneously, allowing easy rollback in case of failure.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the role of logging in DevOps?**  

Logging helps in troubleshooting, analyzing trends, and ensuring application reliability.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is shift-left testing in DevOps?**  

Shift-left means testing earlier in the development lifecycle to catch bugs sooner.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is feature flagging?**  

Feature flags allow enabling or disabling features without deploying new code.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is immutable infrastructure?**  

Infrastructure that is replaced rather than modified to ensure consistency.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are rolling deployments?**  

A deployment strategy that gradually updates instances to avoid downtime.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is canary deployment?**  

A method where new changes are rolled out to a small subset of users before a full deployment.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are microservices, and how do they impact DevOps?**  

Microservices are small, independent services that allow faster development, scalability, and easier deployments.  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you manage secrets in DevOps?**  

Using secret management tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, and Kubernetes Secrets.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is GitOps?**  

A DevOps practice where Git is the single source of truth for infrastructure and application deployment.  
</Step>

<Step>
**Why is containerization important in DevOps?**  

Containers provide portability, consistency, and efficient resource utilization.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the 12-Factor App methodology?**  

A set of best practices for building scalable, cloud-native applications.
