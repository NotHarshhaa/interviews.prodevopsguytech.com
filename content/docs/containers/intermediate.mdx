# Intermediate Level

This section covers advanced concepts in Docker and Kubernetes, including optimization techniques, networking, and deployment strategies.

## Docker Intermediate Questions

<Steps>
<Step>
**What is the difference between Docker ADD and COPY?**  

| Feature | ADD | COPY |
|---------|----|------|
| **Function** | Copies files & extracts compressed files | Copies files only |
| **Supports URLs?** | Yes | No |
| **Best Practice** | Use for archives (`.tar.gz`) | Use for simple file copies |

Example:  

```go
COPY config.json /app/config.json
ADD myapp.tar.gz /app/
```
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you optimize Docker images?**  

- Use **smaller base images** (e.g., `alpine` instead of `ubuntu`).  
- **Multi-stage builds** to reduce image size:  

  ```go
  FROM node:16 AS build
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY . .
  RUN npm install && npm run build

  FROM nginx:alpine
  COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
  ```

- Use `.dockerignore` to avoid unnecessary files.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the difference between Docker ENTRYPOINT and CMD?**  

- `ENTRYPOINT` is **not overridden by command-line arguments**, while `CMD` can be.  
- Best practice: Use `ENTRYPOINT` for fixed commands.  

Example:  

```go
ENTRYPOINT ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
CMD ["-p", "80"]
```
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you debug a running Docker container?**  

- **Get container logs:** `docker logs my-container`  
- **Attach to a running container:** `docker exec -it my-container /bin/sh`  
- **Inspect container details:** `docker inspect my-container`  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a Docker Multi-Stage Build?**  

A **multi-stage build** reduces image size by using multiple `FROM` statements.  

```go
FROM golang:1.17 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp

FROM alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/myapp /myapp
ENTRYPOINT ["/myapp"]
```

The final image **only contains the built binary**.
</Step>

<Step>
**How does Docker handle networking?**  

- **Bridge network (default):** Containers communicate via virtual network.  
- **Host network:** Container shares the host's networking stack.  
- **Overlay network:** Used in **Docker Swarm** for multi-host networking.  

Example:  

```sh
docker network create mynetwork
docker run --network=mynetwork nginx
```
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the difference between Docker Swarm and Kubernetes?**  

| Feature | Docker Swarm | Kubernetes |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Orchestration** | Lightweight, built into Docker | Advanced, feature-rich |
| **Scaling** | Manual | Auto-scaling |
| **Service Discovery** | Built-in | Needs external setup (DNS, Ingress) |
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you remove unused Docker images and containers?**  

```sh
docker system prune -a
```

This removes **stopped containers, unused networks, and dangling images**.
</Step>

<Step>
**What is Docker BuildKit?**  

Docker **BuildKit** improves build speed and caching.  
Enable it with:  

```sh
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build .
```

Benefits:  
‚úÖ **Faster builds**  
‚úÖ **Parallel execution**  
‚úÖ **Improved caching**  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you limit container resource usage?**  

Use `--memory` and `--cpus`:  

```sh
docker run --memory=512m --cpus=1 nginx
```

This limits memory to **512MB** and CPU usage to **1 core**.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Kubernetes Intermediate Questions

<Steps>
<Step>
**How does Kubernetes handle high availability?**  

- Uses **multiple master nodes** to avoid single points of failure.  
- Deployments use **replica sets** to keep applications running.  
- **Load balancing & failover mechanisms** ensure availability.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the role of kubelet in Kubernetes?**  

Kubelet runs on each node and:  
‚úÖ **Communicates with the master node**  
‚úÖ **Ensures containers are running**  
‚úÖ **Monitors container health**  
</Step>

<Step>
**How do you check logs of a running Pod in Kubernetes?**  

```sh
kubectl logs my-pod
kubectl logs -f my-pod  # Stream logs in real-time
```
</Step>

<Step>
**What are Kubernetes Labels and Selectors?**  

Labels **identify** resources, while selectors **filter resources**.  
Example:  

```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    app: my-app
```

To filter pods by label:  

```sh
kubectl get pods -l app=my-app
```
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a Kubernetes Ingress?**  

An **Ingress** manages external access to services.  
Example:  

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: myapp.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: my-service
            port:
              number: 80
```
</Step>
</Steps>
