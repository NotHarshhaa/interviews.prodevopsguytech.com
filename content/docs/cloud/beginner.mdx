# Beginner Level

This section covers fundamental concepts of cloud computing, including basic principles, services, and common practices.

<Steps>
<Step>
**What is cloud computing?**  

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, and software over the internet. It eliminates the need for owning and maintaining physical hardware, allowing users to access scalable resources on a pay-as-you-go model.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are the different types of cloud computing?**  

Cloud computing is classified into three types:  

- **Public Cloud:** Services provided by third-party vendors like AWS, Azure, and GCP, accessible over the internet.  
- **Private Cloud:** Cloud infrastructure dedicated to a single organization, either on-premises or hosted by a provider.  
- **Hybrid Cloud:** A combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are the benefits of cloud computing?**  

- **Scalability:** Resources can be easily scaled up or down.  
- **Cost Efficiency:** No need to invest in physical hardware.  
- **Flexibility:** Access from anywhere using the internet.  
- **Disaster Recovery:** Cloud providers offer backup and recovery solutions.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are the different cloud service models?**  

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Provides virtualized computing resources (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure Virtual Machines).  
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Offers a managed environment for application development (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine).  
- **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Delivers software applications over the internet (e.g., Gmail, Office 365, Salesforce).  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is serverless computing?**  

Serverless computing allows developers to run applications without managing underlying infrastructure. The cloud provider dynamically allocates resources as needed. Examples include AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is virtualization in cloud computing?**  

Virtualization is the process of creating virtual instances of servers, storage, or networks. It enables multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical server, improving resource utilization.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is multi-cloud?**  

Multi-cloud refers to using multiple cloud service providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) for redundancy, cost optimization, and avoiding vendor lock-in.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What are some common cloud deployment models?**  

- **Community Cloud:** Shared infrastructure for a specific group of organizations.  
- **Hybrid Cloud:** Combination of on-premises, private, and public clouds.  
- **Public Cloud:** Services offered to multiple customers over the internet.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the difference between vertical and horizontal scaling?**  

- **Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up):** Increasing resources (CPU, RAM) in an existing server.  
- **Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out):** Adding more servers to distribute the load.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is an Availability Zone (AZ)?**  

An Availability Zone is a physically separate data center within a cloud provider's region, designed for fault tolerance and high availability.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is the Shared Responsibility Model in cloud security?**  

Cloud providers and customers share security responsibilities:  

- **Provider:** Secures hardware, networking, and cloud infrastructure.  
- **Customer:** Secures applications, data, and user access.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)?**  

A VPC is an isolated cloud environment where users can define their own network settings, including subnets, IP addresses, and security groups.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)?**  

An ELB distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is Object Storage in the cloud?**  

Object storage is a cloud-based storage architecture that stores data as objects (instead of files or blocks). Examples include Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Storage.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is Block Storage in cloud computing?**  

Block storage stores data in fixed-sized blocks, commonly used for databases and virtual machines. Examples: AWS EBS, Azure Managed Disks.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?**  

A CDN is a distributed network of servers that caches content close to users for faster delivery. Examples: AWS CloudFront, Azure CDN.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is an IAM role in cloud security?**  

An IAM (Identity and Access Management) role grants permissions to cloud services without needing credentials stored on a server.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is CloudFormation in AWS?**  

AWS CloudFormation is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that automates provisioning of cloud resources using YAML or JSON templates.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)?**  

GKE is Google Cloud's managed Kubernetes service for deploying and managing containerized applications.  
</Step>

<Step>
**What is Azure DevOps?**  

Azure DevOps is a set of development and CI/CD tools for building, testing, and deploying applications in the cloud.  
</Step>
</Steps>
